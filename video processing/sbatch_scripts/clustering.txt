## Clustering

Then locally open the masterscript_yc.m

1. run up to PCA  
	Variance explained to select number of projections (missing code)  
	PCA projections: plot(1-(vals./sum(vals))) 
 
2. Go to SPOCK (spock.princeton.edu) to the folder with all the PCA projections  
```	
printf '%s\n' "$PWD"/*20.mat > projections20.txt  
```
edit runSubs.sh for arrays, savepath, projection_path   

```
sbatch runSubs.sh  
```

3. Go back to MasterScript and Make the trainingsetData list which is next in the code locally

4. K means clusting  
	navigate to folder: cd /jukebox/wang_mkislin/OldData/Jess/code_and_dataset/mouse-behavior/cluster_utilities  
	edit runC_yc.sh with filepath, number of clusters, training set path.
``` bash
sbatch runC_jv.sh 
```
\* 1:10, MaxIter 100, replicate 20, 54 hours
	
\* This will generate a mat file containing a variable 'CC' with nx1 dimension. This tells you which cluster each training data belongs to (n in total).

5. Finish all the plots in Masterscript

6. open runRE_HDK_jv.sh for editing  
	change SBATCH array for size  
	change all input varibales accordingly 

7. put all aligned mat files into one folder  

8. run stateMaps.m
